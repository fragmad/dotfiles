# Cmus Settings 

There is a shell script here which is a modified version of one found within the CMUS wiki (https://github.com/cmus/cmus/wiki/status_display_short_text.sh). All I have changed is how notifications are sent. 

To set this in cmus to notify use these commands: 

```
:set status_display_program=~/.cmus/notify_music.sh
:save
```
